To broadcast as a beacon:

Create a CLBeaconRegion (w minor and major) - 15F73C06-7F62-4DEC-9979-2D26A74B0668
Create a CBPeripheralManager

in viewDidLoad
	- set yourself as the peripheralManager's delegate
	
implement protocol, and didUpdateState method

if poweredOff, stop advertising
if poweredOn, start advertising

use your beacon region's peripheralDataWithMeasuredPower(0) as [NSObject : AnyObject] to advertise

-------------

To detect nearby beacons:

create a location maanger
create a beacon region (use same UUID)
create a statusLabel (link to storyboard)

in viewDidLoad

	- set yourself as the location manager's deegate
	- requestWhenInUseAuthorization (set info key NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription)
	- start monitoring for region // start ranging beacons
	
when we enter a region
	start ranging beacons using our region

when we leave a region
	stop ranging beacons using our region

when we range beacons
	unwrap first beacon as CLBeacon
	switch on proximity, display on screen
